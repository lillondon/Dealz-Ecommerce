<h3>Project Description:</h3>
<p>This project was proposed by Coderhouse's React Course. The idea of the project was to build a simple e-commerce website using ReactJs and Google Firebase.</p>

<h3>Project Requirement:</h3>
<p>In this project, we were challenged to store the products on firebase, fetch and display them on to the user. Also, when buying products from the website, the order is created as a document on firebase with the user's details and the products the user added on the basket.</p>

<h3>Other Features Within the Project:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Routes using React-router-dom library.</li>
  <li>Cart context to manage the products added to the basket.</li>
  <li>Order context to manage buyer's details.</li>
  <li>Use of hooks: <strong>useContext, useEffect, useRef, useState.</strong></li>
  <li>Swiper library to create products slides</li>
  <li><strong>Modal</strong> to display product description</li>
  <li>Firebase 9</li>
 </ul>
